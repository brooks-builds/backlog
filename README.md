# backlog
This is the backlog for projects, rants, and tutorials that Brooks might work on or off stream

## Adding an idea

We're tracking the project ideas in the [issues page](https://github.com/brooks-builds/backlog/issues). If you have an idea that you want to see worked on or discussed please open an issue about your idea!

You can also upvote and discuss about the ideas that you would like to see as well!

## How Brooks Pulls Ideas

When strating a new project, Brooks will look through the list and consider the following

- Upvoted issues
- What Brooks is feeling like
- What kind of projects he's worked on recently

## Goal for each project

The goal for these projects is to be a combination of the following

- Fun to watch
- Can learn by following along
- Is fun to make

To that end, each idea will track the following to make sure we are hitting the goals

### Metrics

- Click-through rate on YouTube
- Watch time on YouTube
- Follows on Twitch
- Subscribers on YouTube

For each project we will decide which metrics we are targeting, and what success looks like. Then we will track them.

## Types of Ideas

Brooks will work on the following types of ideas.

- **Programming** - A project that needs to be programmed and deployed somewhere. These can include desktop applications, web apps/sites, and be of any size (from micro-tools like lambda functions to full games)
- **Tutorial Course** - A tutorial course is one or more videos/streams with the intention of teaching how to build/work with the topic. A project might be associated with a tutorial course.
- **Exploration** - An exploration is a topic or tool that Brooks isn't familiar with and will learn live on stream.
- **Rant** - Brooks will create a video discussing a topic.

### What Programming Languages could the projects be built with?

- Rust (Brooks' favorite)
- JavaScript / Node.js
- PHP 7.4+
- Python

### What Topics is Brooks familiar with for Rantings

- Leadership
- Management (Management is hard, ergo most managers suck)
- Culture (What is company culture, how to build good culture, navigating office politics)
- Software development (Agile, Waterfall, Crunches, Deadlines, etc., Architecture)
