# backlog

This is the backlog for projects that Brooks would work on, both on and off stream.

## How this works

We'll be tracking the projects that we might work on in issues. Tags can be applied to suggest technologies to use.

We can also vote on what projects we would like to see worked on. Note that when Brooks chooses a project to work on he will consider the votes, but will ultimately have the final word on what he works on.

Discussions in each of the issues can help define what the projects are, and what the definition of done for them is. Each of the projects will get their own repositories.

## Types of Projects
